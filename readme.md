### Inkscape Helper

These are helper functions for some Inkscape plugins.

# Running tests

`python -m unittest tests.inkscape_helper_test`

# Deploying

Run `./deploy.sh` (currently only on Linux). This copies the `inkscape_helper` folder to the Inkscape extensions folder so that it is accessible from inkscape extensions.
